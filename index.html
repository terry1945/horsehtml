<strong>20 May 2023.</strong> This will be a testbed for some things I'm learning and working on. So far this project has included:

<ul>
	<li>setting up a web server</li>
	<li>use git to host flies and make them available to the server </li>
	<li>get a domain name </li>
	<li>link the server ip address and domain name </li>	
	<!--<li> </li>	-->
</ul>

<p>
New vim thing I picked up today is :sp newfile.ext opens a second file in the window and you can switch between them with ctl-w w.
</p>
Part of this is technical and part is the imagination things. Next I'll try to add a menu and a few pages. Like to see how to put a theme toggle for dark or light.
